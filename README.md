# Features of Top-Grossing Movies

In the world of cinema, there are always certain films that manage to conquer the box office and achieve high sales. A prominent example of this success is the films produced by Marvel Studios, which have consistently broken sales records and become one of the highest-grossing franchises in the history of cinema. This raises an important question:

**What factors in filmmaking can lead to high sales?**

We aim to identify the factors that affect a film's revenue and develop a formula to estimate a movie's potential box office performance. Additionally, we seek to answer questions such as:

- Does the genre of a film influence its revenue?
- What is the best season for a movie release?
- Which themes are the most popular among top-grossing movies?
